                                href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EPwRdVg5Ug" target="_blank">live cover of "I Want
                                You Back" by The Jackson 5</a>. I was 15 years old at the time, which makes me think
                            how insanely fast time flies by (I'm 26 now). ANYWAY, I was blown away! This was not really
                            a style and genre I was oppossed to, but I had never gone out of my way to listen to any
                            contemporary artists in this category. I'd watched that video so many times back then (and
                            apparently so did a lot of other people!! lol, they were definitely not pulling those
                            numbers back in the day). I was so happy to hear they were releasing a full album (Bad Self
                            Portraits), I ended up preordering the vinyl. After all these years and albums it still has
                            a special place in my heart. It taught me to be open to a greater variety of sounds and got
                            me through plenty good and bad days. They're an extremely talented group (did I mention the
                            lead vocalist sings like an angel???) that deserves nothing but absolute success.</p>

                            Insane vocal range and a surprisingly diverse discography for mainly being an R&B singer.
                            Ology [to me] is a once-in-a-lifetime album that I recommend most listen to at least once.
                            Lyrical poetry that isn't pretentious + powerful vocals. The sound may not be for everyone,
                            but that's okay because I enjoy it regardless :) I'll recommend a song off Neptune since
                            that EP is a little less 'experimental'?? Not sure if that's the word I'm looking for...
                            I've never taken music theory.

                            was scrolling on twitter, and a small creator I followed made a passing comment on how this
                            band makes music that sounds like it belongs in 'Mario Kart'. I had to hear what he was
                            talking about. While his claims didn't quite ring true, I ended up alling in love with this
                            band one ep at a time. And only days later they released their first album, "The Thrill of
                            The Arts". I have never stopped enjoying their music since the day I first played their
                            songs. "Mr. Finish Line" has to be my favirite album from them. All vocalists get to shine
                            and every track oozes passion. However, I have to recommend the OG, the song eveyone gets to
                            vibe to no matter what their musical preferance is. TIMELESS!!!</p>

                            video of Jon at a pre-release fan meetup for his new album (The Human Condition). Pop music
                            at the time really wasn't for me. He had already been wildy successful as a song writer for
                            a lot of popular pop artists, but when it came to his original music he was relatively
                            unknown outside of New York (bar harddcore fans). It took me a few listens to really get his
                            angle. Fast forward and I've been to 2 concerts (it would have been 3 if i didn't mix up the
                            date) and have enjoyed. I know he's been featured in a couple popular mainstream songs
                            (Illenium's "Good Things Fall Apart" comes to mind), but I'm really just interested in his
                            own personal discography. I can't say he's for everyone, but if you're a fan of pop there's
                            a good chance you'll enjoy at least a couple of songs from his discography :)</p>

                            I think that's okay. They have this addicing signature sound that's hard to describe (again
                            I don't know much about theory or instrumentation) but it's easily indentifiable and
                            incredibly satisfying. Some of my favorite tracks feauring vocals would have to be most off

                        <p class="card-text">I used to stalk my friends Spotify history A LOT. One of my old teammates
                            on the lacrosse team was always listening to Honne back in 2015. I finally got around to
                            checking them out and was pretty surprised by their sound. Admittedly I understand people
                            might not enjoy some of their earlier works Like "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX5f0NcqlMs" target="_blank">Warm on A Cold Night</a>" (still
                            have a soft spot for it) due to the vocals being a little grainy, however I enjoy the
                            texture of the
                            main vocalist's voice. I've enjoyed pretty much everything they've put out at this
                            point. Their 2020 album "No Song Without You" has a couple of my favorites. It's a little
                            sentimental for me since it dropped at a pretty rough time in my life. I don't like to
                            overplay the music but when i get a chance to sit down and listen when I'm in the mood, it's
                            comforting I guess.</p>

                        <p class="card-text">Back in summer 2013 "Royals" had just came out. I remember being late to
                            take my senior pictures. On my way to Pasadena to the photo studio with my Dad, the song
                            came on a new release segment on a satellite radio station. It ended up really clicking with
                            me. I shared it with my cousin, and since then the two of us have been pretty big fans of
                            her music. She's definitely an artist you have to be in the mood for, but when you are, it
                            hits just right.</p>

                            teen's up to now. Songs I could remember the melody of but not the name, or maybe a remix of
                            a song from an artist I liked. Insanely talented and a unique sound like no other, I've
                            really grown and had the pleasure to appreciate his art in the past couple of years. Time
                            dissapears when i listen to his music, it's so comforting. I feel
                            like I'd be doing a disservice to not include his live
                            session of his EP "Ylang Ylang".</p>
